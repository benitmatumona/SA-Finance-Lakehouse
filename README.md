# 🇿🇦 SA-Banking-Transaction-ETL-Fraud-Detection-Pipeline

A production-style Data Engineering project that simulates a South African banking system. The project generates realistic banking data, loads it into PostgreSQL through an ETL pipeline, orchestrates workflows with Apache Airflow, and performs analytical SQL queries. It is designed to demonstrate the complete data engineering lifecycle while serving as a stepping stone toward Machine Learning Engineering.

| Column | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| customer_id | Primary key |
| full_name | Customer full name |
| province | South African province |
| join_date | Date customer joined the bank |

---

## Accounts

| Column | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| account_id | Primary key |
| customer_id | Foreign key to Customers |
| account_type | Cheque, Savings or Credit |
| open_date | Account opening date |

---

## Transactions

| Column | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| transaction_id | Primary key |
| account_id | Foreign key to Accounts |
| transaction_date | Transaction date |
| transaction_type | Deposit, Withdrawal, Card Purchase, EFT, Salary |
| merchant_name | Merchant involved |
| amount | Transaction amount |
| reference | Transaction reference |
| balance_after_transaction | Running account balance |
| is_fraud | Fraud indicator |

# 📈 Data Generation

The project creates realistic banking data including:

- Customers
- Accounts
- Transactions

Business rules include:

- Accounts cannot be opened before a customer joins the bank.
- Transactions cannot occur before an account is opened.
- Each customer can have between 1 and 3 account types.
- Each account contains multiple transactions.
- Fraudulent transactions are randomly generated.
- Transaction references are generated according to transaction type.

---

# 🔄 ETL Pipeline

The ETL pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Read generated CSV files.
2. Validate the data.
3. Connect to PostgreSQL.
4. Load Customers.
5. Load Accounts.
6. Load Transactions.
7. Commit the transaction.
8. Handle errors.
9. Close database connection.

---

# 📊 Analytics

The project answers business questions such as:

- Customer segmentation by province
- Monthly revenue
- Fraud detection
- Dormant accounts
- Top spending customers
- Provincial revenue analysis
